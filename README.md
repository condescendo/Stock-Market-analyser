# Stock-Market-analyser
Stock Market Prediction Web App based on Machine Learning and Sentiment Analysis of Tweets (API keys included in code). The front end of the Web App is based on Flask and Wordpress. The App forecasts stock prices of the next seven days for any given stock under NASDAQ or NSE as input by the user. Predictions are made using LSTM. The Web App combines the predicted prices of the next seven days with the sentiment analysis of tweets to give recommendation whether the price is going to rise or fall.
